Technologies used:
CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, jQuery

My process/approach:
I started out by creating the structure of my website in the HTML. I then added styling through CSS. Lastly, I added functionality and special effects such as the carousel and nav scrolling and highlighting through jQuery.

Unsolved problems:
The hamburger disappears upon clicking it.

My biggest wins and challenges:
The most time consuming part of this website was understanding and implementing the jQuery functions. The logic was complex and it took a while to get it to work. However, I'm happy with the simple and elegant design.
