Technologies used:
CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, jQuery

My process/approach:
I started out by creating the structure of my website with HTML. I then added styling through CSS. Lastly, I added functionality and special effects such as the carousel, nav smooth scrolling and highlighting through jQuery.

Unsolved problems:
The hamburger disappears after a click event is triggered on it. I can't get it to stay on the screen without altering the header image. I believe it has something to do with the css property 'position' with value 'fixed'.

My biggest wins and challenges:
The most challenging part of this website was understanding and implementing the jQuery functions. The logic was complex and it took a while to get it to work. However, I'm happy with the simple and elegant design of the page.
