Technologies used:
CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, jQuery, Formspree

My process/approach:
I started out by creating the structure of my website with HTML. I then added styling through CSS. Next, I added functionality and special effects through jQuery. Lastly, I integrated external links such as social media accounts and Formspree service.

Unsolved problems:
The hamburger disappears after a click event is triggered on it. At first, I couldn't get it to stay on the screen without altering the header image. I figured that by changing its z-index, I could get the hamburger to be visible at all times on mobile screens. But now, both the nav links and the hamburger are erroneously being displayed at the same time. I believe it has something to do with the css property 'position' with value 'fixed'.
Another bug I'm working to resolve is the inability of Formspree and the form submit button's click event handler to simultaneously work.

My biggest wins and challenges:
The most challenging part of this website was understanding and implementing the jQuery functions especially the carousel and nav smooth scrolling and highlighting. The logic was complex and it took a while to get it to work. However, I'm happy with the simple and elegant design of the page.
